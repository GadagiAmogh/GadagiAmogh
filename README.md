Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

In love with machines, as a Mechanical Engineer and an AI/ML Engineer.

A passionate Mechanical Engineer and AI enthusiast who wants to build game changing AL/ML products to help disabled. Want to talk about AI, just give a buzzz!

Constantly trying to make machines speak my mind. Imagine controlling players in FIFA (PS) with your mind instead of a controller, right! That's the stuff
or 
Imagine disabled becoming abled people just like the rest of us! I believe all of this is possible and can make this world a better place.

### Interests

If you are ever in town and catchup for a quick game of badminton, squash, volleyball, or tennis, connect with me on Instagram/LinkedIn. I bet I'll beat you unless, of course, you are as competitive as me. I also go on hikes, if you were ever to join.  I like to contribute to society, be it volunteering or donations or any other form, as much as I can, because I strongly believe in making this world a better place.

### What I'm doing now 

Currently working as a Mechanical Engineer along with developing my AI/ML skills.
Taking up MSc in AI/Ml and other courses from MOOC and without wasting time implementing mechanical engineering and AI skills to build game changing products.
