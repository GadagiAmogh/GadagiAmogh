Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm a passionate Mechanical and AI/ML engineer who wants to build game changing AL/ML products to help disabled. Want to talk about AI, just give a buzz!

Constantly trying to make machines speak my mind. Imagine controlling players in FIFA (PS) with your mind instead of a controller, right! That's the stuff!</p>
or even better </p>
Imagine disabled becoming abled people with the help of technology! I believe all of this is possible and together we can make this world a better place.</p>

### Interests

If you are ever in town and want to catchup for a quick game of badminton, squash, volleyball, or tennis, connect with me on Instagram/LinkedIn. I bet I'll beat you unless, of course, you are as competitive as me. I also go on hikes, if you were ever to join.  I like to contribute to society, be it volunteering or donations or any other form, as much as I can, because I strongly believe in making this world a better place.

### What I'm doing now 

Currently working as a Mechanical Engineer along with developing my AI/ML skills.</p>
Taking up MSc in AI/Ml and other courses from MOOC and without wasting time implementing mechanical engineering and AI skills to build game changing products.
